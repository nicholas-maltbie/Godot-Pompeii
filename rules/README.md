## Game Components

1. A square grid map representing the city of Pompeii. The map has the following attributes:
    - A set of 'valid' tiles within the city.
    - Various buildings each labeled by a given color a number.
    - Gates at various locations around the edge of the city.
    - Tiles where an eruption of lava may begin during phase two.
1. A deck of cards with three different types of cards:
    - Cards corresponding to a given building within the city.
    - "A.D. 79" eruption cards which trigger the change of phase for the game.
    - Omen cards which trigger a sacrifice to the volcano when drawn.
1. A bag of lava tiles:
    - Each lava tile has a symbol identifying where it can be placed within the board.
    - Each symbol has a starting location on the board where the lava flow for that symbol will being.

The various buildings within the city are summarized via the following attributes:

- The building will take up some number of tiles within the map.
- Each square that the building occupies has a number of citizens that can be placed within it (between 0 and 4).
- Each building is identified with a given color and number -- These buildings each will have corresponding cards within the deck.
- Some buildings may be "neural" and not have a color or number.

For the game map, there are 11 buildings total with the following color and number of available spaces

| Building Number | Color      | Spaces Available |
|----------------:|:-----------|-----------------:|
|               1 | light blue |                4 |
|               2 | purple     |                4 |
|               3 | purple     |                5 |
|               4 | light blue |                7 |
|               5 | purple     |                4 |
|               6 | turquoise  |                7 |
|               7 | purple     |                3 |
|               8 | light blue |                5 |
|               9 | turquoise  |                4 |
|              10 | brown      |                5 |
|              11 | brown      |                5 |

There are the following components of the game:

- Up to 36 pieces representing citizens of each player color.
- 53 cards each corresponding to a building on the map. There is one card for each available location in a given building. (Eg, if building 5 has 4 available places, there would be 4 cards in the deck for building 5). Each building also has a corresponding color.
- 7 omen cards.
- 1 "A.D. 79" card.
- 45 lava tiles showing one of six different symbols - vase, helmet, mask (7 x each) and scroll, column, coin (8 x each)

## Game Setup

Each player start off with a number of citizens depending on the total number of players in the game.

- 4 player game - 25 citizens for each player.
- 3 player game - 30 citizens for each player.
- 2 player game - 36 citizens for each player.

The deck setup is setup as follows:

1. Create seven piles of 4 cards each.
1. Give one of the seven piles to each player.
1. Shuffle the omen cards into the remaining 25 building cards (53 building cards - 28 set aside earlier).
1. Put the "A.D. 79" card on top of the pile of omen and building cards.
1. Place two of the seven piles of 4 cards set aside earlier on top of the "A.D. 79" card.
1. Return any remaining piles of cards back to the box.

## Game Phases

Game is split into two halves

1. Citizens Move to Pompeii
2. Catastrophe - Run for your lives!

### Phase I : Citizens Move to Pompeii

Players take turns playing a card and then placing one of their citizens to the corresponding building then draw a card at the end of their turn.

- After the first "A.D. 79" card is drawn, the following rules take effect:
  - The relative rule:
    > When placing their citizen in a building: For each game piece already in the building, regardless of color, players may place the same number of pieces in  a different building of the same color, or in a neutral building (max of 1 relative per building, cannot place relatives in the same building that the initial piece was played). Pieces played via the relative rule do not trigger the relative rule again, no chain-reactions.
  - Omen card: when drawn, the active player must take an opponent's game piece and drop it into the volcano, then draw another card.
  - After the "A.D. 79" card has been drawn, it is shuffled back into the bottom 15 cards of the deck. Do this by counting off the bottom 15 cards, shuffling the card into that pile, then placing it back **under** the deck.
- After the second "A.D. 79" card is drawn, all players return their remaining cards and pieces to the game box.

Additional Rule Clarifications:

- Joker Cards - If a player has a card for a building which is full, the player may place their piece on a free space in a  building of their choice, regardless of the color of that building.

### Phase II : Catastrophe - Run for Your Lives

Initial lava flow phase where players take turns drawing 1 lava tile and placing it on the board starting with the player to the left of the player who draw the "A.D. 79" card. This continues until 6 tiles have been placed.

Lava placement rules:

- Each lava tile is marked with a symbol.
- Lava tiles must be placed orthogonally adjacent to existing lava of the same type.
- The first lava tile drawn of a specific type must be placed on the starting tile for that symbol.
- When placed, lava tiles kill all citizens on that space and the citizens are placed in the volcano.
- Citizens are also thrown into the volcano if they are surrounded by lava tiles and are enclosed such that they can no longer reach a city gate. Lava tiles may still be placed in the enclosed area on future turns.

Starting with the player to the left of the player who placed the 6th lava tile, players take turns moving their citizens out of the city. Each turn the player does the following:

1. Draw and place a lava tile using the same rules as earlier.
2. Move two **different** citizens in the city. Each citizen may move a number of spaces equal to the total number of citizens on the square where the piece begins it's move. For example, if a square had 3 pieces in it (including itself), the citizen may move up to three spaces.
    - To exit the city, the piece must spend one additional movement space to leave through a gate touching the square the piece currently occupies.

Game End: the game ends once the last lava tile is drawn from the bag. The player who drew the lava tile will finish their turn. All game pieces left on the board are then thrown into the volcano.

- A game may end earlier if there are no pieces left in the city who can escape.

Additional Rule Clarifications:

- Exception: If a citizen is alone at the start of the player's first move, that player may move that citizen again with their second move.
- Important: If a player only has one piece left in the city, they may use **both** of their moves on that piece.
- A player who has no citizens left in the city only draws and places a lava tile on their turn.

## Lava Placement Edge Case

It is theoretically possible that there is no legal place to play a given lava tile. The rules do not specify what should happen in this edge case. I couldn't find a clarification on this rule, but did find a discussion thread outlining three options for handling this scenario:

[Board Game Geek - Unable to place lava tile... weird edge case](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2501920/unable-to-place-lava-tile-weird-edge-case)

The discussion thread was submitted by user James Perry on Sep 12th, 2020.

> We played a game where the Column lava tiles got surrounded. When the next column tile was drawn we looked and could not find the rule to determine where to go next...
>
> The two options we debated were:
>
> 1) You don’t place the tile... no legal placement
> 2) It becomes a wild (similar to the rules for filling a building). The next tile of that type would play off of that.
>
> We went with #2 because it felt a little more in line with the spirit of the game.
>
> Thoughts?

Another user Liam suggested a third option for resolving the scenario:

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD029 : Keeping formatting from forum discussion. -->
> 3) keep drawing tiles until you get one you can legally place.

There was some discussion about how to resolve this situation and the rules do not define this scenario.

Since this computer implementation must define all scenarios, I will move ahead with suggestion from Liam, draw until you receive a tile you can legally place. This shouldn't affect the result of the game as this is an odd ege case that should not be very common.

## Unrelated Deck Setup Tangent

This rule setup the deck seem a bit confusing, I blame the fact that the rules were originally written in German and then translated to English. Also, the game has multiple editions and may have different rules depending on the edition.

I would re-write the deck preparation as follows:

1. Separate the 53 building, 7 omen, and "A.D. 79" card into different piles.
1. Shuffle the 53 building cards.
1. Deal 4 building cards to each player.
1. Count out 25 face-down building cards and shuffle them with the 7 omen cards as the start of the deck.
1. Place the "A.D. 79" card on top of the deck (the previously shuffled 25 building and 7 omen cards).
1. Count out 8 more face-down building cards and place them on top of the "A.D. 79" card.
1. Return remaining cards to the box, do not look at them.
    - The number of remaining cards depends on number of players, will be 4 cards for a 4-player game, 8 cards for a 3-player game, and 12 cards for a 2-player game.

After this, the deck should look like the following:

1. 8 building cards at the top.
1. 1 "A.D. 79" card.
1. 32 at the bottom of the deck (25 building + 7 omen cards shuffled together).
